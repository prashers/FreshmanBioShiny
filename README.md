# FreshmanBioShiny
This Shiny app was developed for an introductory biology lab course (BIOL1082L) at the University of Cincinnati to help students analyze and visualize penguin social networks using real RFID detection data. The app supports a newly introduced data science module that familiarizes students with R-based data analysis (app first developed in Fall 2023).

Students participate in interactive lab activities where they simulate penguin movements and generate RFID detection data. They then use the app to explore both their class-generated dataset and real penguin data from the Cincinnati Zoo. The app allows users to:

- Upload RFID detection data and merge it with penguin ID information.
- Adjust time thresholds for defining social associations.
- Generate interactive social network diagrams showing penguin interactions.
- Compute and download social network metrics (degree and strength) for each penguin.

By using this app, students gain hands-on experience with data visualization and network analysis in R without needing extensive coding knowledge.
